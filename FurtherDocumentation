# ETL Pipeline for IT Salary Data

## Introduction
This Python script is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing IT salary data. It extracts data from a CSV file, transforms it by cleaning and enhancing the data, and then loads it into a database for further analysis. The project also includes data visualisation using Matplotlib.

## Dependencies
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- chardet (for automatic encoding detection)
- sqlalchemy (for database operations)
- matplotlib (for data visualization)

## Functions

### `transform_iso_code(code)`
This function maps ISO 3166 country codes to actual country names.

### `detect_encoding(file_path)`
Detects the encoding of a file using chardet.

### `apply_transformations(df)`
Applies various transformations to the DataFrame, such as replacing codes with descriptive names and enhancing data.

### `load_and_display_csv(csv_file_path, n=4)`
Loads a CSV file, detects its encoding, cleans the data, displays the first `n` rows, and saves the cleaned data to a new CSV file.

### `insert_dataframe_into_db(df, table_name, engine)`
Inserts the DataFrame into a specified database table using SQLAlchemy.

### `fetch_data_from_db(engine, table_name)`
Fetches data from the database using SQLAlchemy.

### Data Visualisation Functions
- `create_company_size_country_location_plot(df)`: Creates a bar plot showing company size distribution by country.
- `create_country_salary_plot(df)`: Creates a bar plot showing average salary by country.
- `create_experience_salary_plot(df)`: Creates a stacked bar plot showing average salary by country and experience level.
- `create_company_size_experience_plot(df)`: Creates a stacked bar plot showing average salary by company size and experience level.

## Usage
1. Specify the path to your CSV file (`csv_file_path`) in the `main` function.
2. Run the script to execute the ETL pipeline.
3. The script will perform data extraction, transformation, loading into a database, and data visualisation.

## Configuration
- You can configure the database connection by modifying the `db_path` variable in the `main` function.
- Replace `'your_table_name'` with the desired table name where data should be inserted.

## Note
- Ensure that the required dependencies are installed.
- This script is a template and can be customised to suit specific data sources and transformations.

Feel free to adapt and extend this ETL pipeline for your specific IT salary data analysis needs.
